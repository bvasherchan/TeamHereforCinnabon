# Prophet Time Series Rolling Forecast Model: Maverik

**Capstone Final MSBA - 2023**

**Team "Here for Cinnabon"**

This is the rolling forecast ```Prophet``` model shown in the presentation for Maverik in the Fall 2023 MSBA Capstone.  We created a rolling window forecast model that produces daily predictions for a given horizon period (365 days). This model takes into account new sales data, and re-trains the model to produce a more accurate prediction every day.
